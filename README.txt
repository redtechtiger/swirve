---===--- Swirve Framework v1.1 Documentation ---===---

Hello fellow traveller! I see you have found the FTP
server. Here's a few quick trips to get started.


- The FTP server has access to ALL system files,
  so DON'T GO AROUND POKING! Access files with
  caution.

- Swirve stores all data in the following folder:
  /home/serveruser/data/

- If you're looking for your server files, check here:
  /home/serveruser/data/serverdata/
  Then make sure to select the correct directory.
